# AngularJS-Service
The idea of this little project is to show the use of AngularJS Service, $http and REST API. To work in this example I'll need:
- NodeJS 
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- JSON Server
- HTTP Server
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox

Once installed the last nodejs version, proceed with the installation of the following app in a virtual machine
- npm install http-server -g
- npm install json-server -g

The little project is gonna show the use of service
- Value/Constant, these two type are very similar. You can share primitives, objects and functions
- Factory, pretty similar to the Service. The main difference is that you can return other types besides objects
- Service, always return an object. It should preferably be used rather than the other Service types
